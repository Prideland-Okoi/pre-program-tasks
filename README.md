## 1. Simple Calculator Program

This is a basic calculator script written in Python. This calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square functions. The user can select a function, enter input, and view the result. In addition, the app includes error checks for invalid input and division by zero.

### Requirements

python 3.10.7
scripts are written in bash 4.4.23(2)
pycodestyle 2.10.0

### Usage

- Run the calculator.py file in a Python environment.

- Follow the on-screen instructions to select a function and enter input.

- View the result of the selected function.

- To exit the program, choose the "q" option.

### Functions

**Addition:** Adds two numbers.

**Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first.

**Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers.

**Division:** Divides the first number by the second (with error check for division by zero).

**Square:** Squares a single number.

#### Notes

- Input validation is implemented to handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).

- The program will continue running until the user chooses `q` to exit.
